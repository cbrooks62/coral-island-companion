# Coral-Island-Companion
---
I built this app to make playing the indie game Coral Island a more enjoyable experience. It allows users to store and keep track of in game events and reminders as well as personal tasks that need to be completed. The app also gives you the resources to stay in touch with the game's festivals and characters.
